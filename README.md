# SVGMorph
(SWT22-04)

Implements the SVG Standard in the Squeak programming language as well as providing a basic SVG Editor. 

## Installation
Install `metacello-work` in your Squeak-image if you have not done so already. In any case, copy the following into your workspace to get started:
```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'SVGMorph';
    repository: 'github://hpi-swa-teaching/SVGMorph:dev/packages';
    load
```

Now you will be able to use `SVGMorph` and `SVGEditor` in your Squeak image.

## Usage

There are three ways of using SVGMorph:

### Using SVGMorph directly

The SVGMorph class provides you with a number of constructor methods for loading SVGs directly. For example, you can provide `SVGMorph fromString:` with the string of an SVG to be parsed.

### Using the SVG Editor

Run `SVGEditor open` in your Workspace. The editor will open in a new window.

### Using `SVGMorph example`

Run `SVGMorph example.` in your Squeak Workspace. You will be presented with a file choosing dialog to select a file to be opened in a new window.
